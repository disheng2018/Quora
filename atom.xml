We tried to explain that we can’t afford it, and she stopped speaking with us. What should we do?"></a><strong>My teenager wants only an Apple phone. We tried to explain that we can’t afford it, and she stopped speaking with us. What should we do?</strong></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);"><em><strong>Tawni Doliveira</strong></em></span></p><blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">659.9k Views · 2.7k Upvotes</span></strong></p></blockquote><p>When I was 7, I was diagnosed with Type 1 <u>Diabetes</u>. I was in 2nd grade. My mom decided to get me a flip phone through Tracfone to text her if my blood sugar drops or if the nurse doesn’t show up to give me my <u>insulin</u> dose. </p><p>Every other year after that I got a new Tracfone for Christmas. When I turned 12 or 13, I asked my mom for a newer, better phone. I had just moved to the high school (7th-12th grade) and everyone else had nice iPhones. I knew my mom couldn’t afford an iPhone so I searched eBay for any phone that would do more than a cheap Tracfone.</p><p>At my school, teachers allow students to use a phone to search things, take pictures of <u>dissections</u> or powerpoints, or do our online assignments. I wanted to be able to be like everyone else and not have to go to get a teacher to unlock the room to the laptops to be able to do what others do or have to use a dictionary and have homework because it took too long to find the definitions.</p><p>I found a cheap android phone by the company Blu and my mom bought it for me. I loved it. My mom couldn’t afford data so I used the school’s WiFi.</p><p>About 2 years later, I wanted an iPhone. I got bullied for being poor and having a phone that became slow and was considered cheap. My mom got me a <u>refurbished</u> iPhone 6s Plus for Christmas 2016. I’m still using this phone and I love it.</p><p>Yes, I’d LOVE to have the newest iPhone but I’m very thankful to have this phone. My family hasn’t had an income for 4 years yet my mom figured out a way to get me a better phone that would last a while. </p><p>I’m NOT telling you that this is what you should do. What I’m saying is ask her why she thinks she needs an iPhone. Ask her why she feels that way. Try to compromise with her. But <u>hear her out</u>. Teenagers often feel as if their feelings are invalid and that we don’t have good points.</p><p>Have a conversation, don’t yell or raise your voice or have an attitude that screams “I’m better than you and only my points and views are valid”. It makes us more angry because our side of the conversation isn’t being heard.</p><p>All I’m saying is listen to her.

Never date someone who is with someone else, even if they are willing to leave them for you — especially if they leave them for you. If they leave them for you, they will leave you for the next person.<br>Never date someone because you think it is your last chance.

Looks surely matter and she’s beautiful—but she has other things going on too.</p><p>She’s an archaeology professor at USF, with a focus on digital archaeology, so she is scanning artifacts and various cool things. She spent years living on excavations in Europe and Turkey (her focus is Bronze Age Archaeology).</p><p>Like most people with a Ph.D., she’s super motivated, smart, and fun to talk to.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed, I have an eclectic set of interests and consume a lot of information. In the past, I’ve had girlfriends roll their eyes and call me a weirdo when I start talking about goofy niche topics (things I write about here on Quora).</p><p>Unsurprisingly, she doesn’t roll her eyes. Her name is Laura. We collaborate a lot on life and work decisions.</p><p>She’s an editor for several academic journals so she’s always great at giving me feedback about my stuff.

Rather, I’d like to zero in on the fact that you found someone who can relate to you and your interests. That to me is far, far, far more valuable than their external beauty.

Procrastinate on procrastinating.</li><li><strong>Do Something ASAP</strong> - When anything comes in your mind do something about it immediately, even if it is just planning it. Get it out of your head.</li><li><strong>Set Your Intentions -</strong> Know what you are going to do today. Lead the day actively.</li><li><strong>Check Things Off -</strong> When you are done with something make a clear-cut mark to be done with it.</li><li><strong>Start Early -</strong> Everyone works better in the morning. Do something difficult before you’d normally get up. You’ll feel great all day.</li><li><strong>Remind Yourself -</strong> 99% of all self-improvement is repetition. Multiple daily reminders ingrain concepts.</li><li><strong>Control Your Time -</strong> If you don’t control your time you’ll end up wasting a lot of it. You only have 24 hours each day and maybe only this one life; Don’t waste a single second.</li><li><strong>Go Outside -</strong> Add a bit of nature (ideally a natural body of water of some sort) to your daily routine. The calm will often reset you.</li><li><strong>Meditate</strong> - Work out your body, your mind and your heart and soul. Go inward. Learn about yourself. And improve.</li><li><strong>Love Yourself -</strong> Spend some time each day feeling proud or happy or loving with who you are. You spend 24 hours a day with yourself. That’s a long time to hate someone.</li><li><strong>Have Fun -</strong> Do something each day that’s just fun. Follow a hobby, pick up a new skill or read in your favorite book.</li><li><strong>Drink More Water -</strong> While 2L a day is recommended, 3–4L will really make you feel healthy and refreshed.</li><li><strong>Read A Book -</strong> 1 Chapter a day or 10 pages.</li><li><strong>Eat More Greens -</strong> Fruits and Vegetables over candy and snacks. Try having 3–4 Fruits or Veggies in every meal.</li><li><strong>Focus On Earning -</strong> Instead of trying save try to earn more. What could you do today that might make you and your time worth more?</li><li><strong>Act Big -</strong> Go for 10x more of what you think you want. Take it seriously and give it an honest shot. You’ll reach much further as your mental limits won’t hold you back as much.</li><li><strong>Reflect -</strong> Whatever you did, learn to reflect on it. What went well? What did not? What is one thing you <em>will</em> do better tomorrow?</li><li><strong>Be A Hero -</strong> First identify who that is and then take a step there daily. It makes an astounding difference when you choose where you want to go.</li><li><strong>Hug Someone -</strong> Release some oxytocin by being physical. If that is not possible then help someone. If you can’t do that, then be charitable.</li><li><strong>Be Present -</strong> This moment is all that matters. Take it in. You are alive now. Work with purpose, laugh with true joy or do what you need to do in the here and now.</li><li><strong>Break A Limit -</strong> Push a boundary and test your limits. Challenge yourself to be better than you were before so you move into who you want to be.</li></ol><details>  <summary><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt">翻译待更新<br></span></p></details><br>https://qr.ae/prXA02<p><br><img src="/images/Quora_qrcode.png"> </p>]]></content>

Wanna chill and play PubG ? Better use Sofa.</li><li>Stop using your phone as Alarm clock and if you can, keep your phone in the other room while sleeping. This way your phone won’t be the first thing you check in the morning and you are actually taking the temptation away. Try it, you will sleep much better and feel amazing in the morning.</li><li><strong>Stop eating sugar.</strong> Trust me, sugar does nothing good for you and will rot your brain. Wanna eat something sweet after a meal ? Try a couple of strawberries or grapes instead or some honey will also do the trick.</li><li>Start reading and I mean physical books. They are an amazing stress reliever.</li><li>Never stop dreaming and keep on setting goals. You must have heard the phrase “Never Settle” a number of times in life and there’s a reason for that. When you work towards something, towards a specific goal, then you’ll automatically be motivated to do other stuff. That energy, that feeling of seeing something in front of you and then working towards it is amazing.</li><li><strong>Exercise daily. Period.</strong></li><li><strong>Go outside for a minimum of 30 min daily and get some sunlight.</strong> Early morning is the best time. OUTSIDE GOOOODDD, INSIDE BAADDD.</li><li>Always use protection. All your success wouldn’t mean shit if you got an unexpected bun in the oven.</li><li>Never ever watch porn. No matter what happens, never ever watch porn. Use your imagination if need be but avoid porn at all cost. I can’t stress this point enough.</li><li><strong>Realize that life works at a very slow pace.</strong> This sounds a lot easy but trust me, its way more difficult in practical. In the age of internet, we easily develop the habit of instant gratification. Want something to eat ? It’s just 2 clicks away. Wanna order clothes ? Just pick your phone and select from latest trends and this will cost you less than actually visiting the store or a restaurant, thanks to discounts. This creates a habit loop of EXPECTING everything INSTANTLY, which is the number one reason for stress. We just don’t realize that everything takes time, that dreams are not achieved by working overnight and this is why most people give up. So slow down, take a deep breath and slowly but constantly work towards your goal.</li><li>In the pipelne.. edit coming soon ;)</li></ol><p>And never forget to enjoy life every chance you get. Realize that one day, not today, not tomorrow, but one day in distant future, probably in a galaxy far far away, you are going to die and everything will be for nothing. So work on yourself but make sure to enjoy in everything you pick to do in life.</p><details>  <summary><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt">翻译待更新<br></span></p></details><br>https://qr.ae/prXAE0<p><br><img src="/images/Quora_qrcode.png"> </p>]]></content>

We were in the carefree phase of life, I told her I didn’t want kids, and she was not thinking about them then either.<br><br>We got married, I was 20 she was 22, and I did not change my <u>stance</u>, on kids. As I was a very selfish person, struggling financially. Plus I went to the gym 2 hours a day, 6 days a week, from age 15 up to this point. I also jogged 45 minutes daily, life was all about me.<br><br>She was age 31 and I was 29. She told me she wanted a kid or 2 or 3. This scared a selfish loser type like me..lol<br><br>She said if I didn’t agree, she was going to have to leave me, as her clock was running out. She said she thought I would change my mind, is why she didn’t push kids till now.<br><br>We went for it, and had our daughter. My life was never the same. It was much better. I can’t put into words how great this was, but scary at the same time.<br><br>I seemed to be rising to the occasion, being a dad. It was like I was one of those <u>carefree</u> <u>otters</u> you see playing all day on a nature show, then I turned into the great otter parent. We would still still play, but involve the kid, then go back to hard working parent mode.<br><br>3 years later we had her sister. I was trying to not do it, as I was really struggling financially.

One morning, my mom was going downstairs to make dad breakfast, she had a heart attack and fell. My father picked her up as best he could and almost dragged her into the truck. At full speed, without respecting traffic lights, he drove her to the hospital.</p><p>When he arrived, unfortunately, she was no longer with us.</p><p>During the funeral, my father did not speak; his gaze was lost. He hardly cried.</p><p>That night, his children joined him. In an atmosphere of pain and <u>nostalgia</u>, we remembered beautiful anecdotes and he asked my brother, a <u>theologian</u>, to tell him where Mom would be at that moment. My brother began to talk about life after death, and guesses as to how and where she would be.</p><p>My father listened carefully. Suddenly he asked us to take him to the <u>cemetery</u>.</p><p>Dad!” we replied, “it’s 11 at night, we can’t go to the cemetery right now!”</p><p>He raised his voice, and with a <u>glazed</u> look he said:</p><p>“Don’t argue with me, please don’t argue with the man who just lost his wife of 55 years.”</p><p>There was a moment of respectful silence, we didn’t argue anymore. We went to the cemetery, we asked the night <u>watchman</u> for permission. With a flashlight, we reached the tomb. My father <u>caressed</u> her, prayed, and told his children, who watched the scene moved:</p><blockquote><p>“It was 55 years… you know? No one can talk about true love if they have no idea what it’s like to share life with a woman.”</p></blockquote><p>He paused and wiped his face. </p><blockquote><p>“She and I, we were together in that crisis. I changed jobs …” he continued. “We packed up when we sold the house and moved out of town. We shared the joy of seeing our children finish their careers, we mourned the departure of loved ones side by side, we prayed together in the waiting room of some hospitals, we support each other in pain, we hug each Christmas, and we forgive our mistakes…</p><p>Children, now it’s gone, and I’m happy, do you know why?</p><p><strong>Because she left before me. She didn’t have to go through the <u>agony</u> and pain of burying me, of being left alone after my departure.</strong> I will be the one to go through that, and I thank God. I love her so much that I wouldn’t have liked her to suffer…”</p></blockquote><p>When my father finished speaking, my brothers and I had tears streaming down our faces. We hugged him, and he comforted us, “It’s okay, we can go home, it’s been a good day.”</p><p>That night I understood what true love is; It is far from <u>romanticism</u>, it does not have much to do with <u>eroticism</u>, or with sex, rather it is linked to work, to complement, to care and, above all, to the true love that two really <u>committed</u> people <u>profess</u>“.</p><p>Peace in your hearts.</p><p>Love and Light.</p><details>  <summary><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt">待更新</span></p></details><p><span style="color: rgb(70, 118, 217);">▌</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Luiza Carneiro:</strong></em><br>Love is not <u>infatuation</u> as lots of people believe.

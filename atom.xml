Old Benji thought differently.</p><details>  <summary><span style='color:white;font-weight:bold'>展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style='color:red;font-size:12pt'>翻译待更新</span></p></details><p>Franklin once had a very powerful political <u>rival</u> who was <u>hellbent on</u> making his life miserable. Franklin knew that it would be beneficial to have this man on his side, but instead of <u>groveling</u> for his approval, he took a <u>counter-intuitive</u> approach. He knew his rival was in possession of a very rare and valuable book, and simply asked him to borrow it. After a few days, he returned it with a thank you note and, surprisingly, his rival became his friend.</p><details>  <summary><span style='color:white;font-weight:bold'>展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style='color:red;font-size:12pt'>翻译待更新</span></p></details><p>What Franklin <u>tapped into</u> is a well-known psychological principle known as <u>cognitive dissonance</u>. Basically, cognitive dissonance is the tension that results from having two contradictory beliefs in our mind at the same time. This stress is uncomfortable, so we automatically alter one of our beliefs to conform with the other to resolve this conflict.</p><details>  <summary><span style='color:white;font-weight:bold'>展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style='color:red;font-size:12pt'>翻译待更新</span></p></details><p>In the case of Franklin, his rival held the belief: “I do not like Benjamin Franklin.” Upon doing him the favor, however, he was forced to come to terms with another belief: “It’s a pain in the ass to do favors for other people, so I only do favors for people I like.” These two beliefs are in conflict, and since he cannot un-loan the book, he was forced to soften and eventually reverse his ill-will towards Franklin.</p><p>The secret of the Benjamin Franklin effect is this: <strong>If you want people to like you, ask them to do favors for you.</strong></p><details>  <summary><span style='color:white;font-weight:bold'>展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style='color:red;font-size:12pt'>翻译待更新</span></p></details><p><span style="color: rgb(70, 118, 217);">▌</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Feifei-Wang-6">Feifei Wang</a></strong></p><p>I remember a similar experiment: Two group of people are asked to participate an activity.

Mom believed that grandson needed to be “<u>straightened out</u>”. I <u>was crushed to</u> think I wasn’t an <u>adequate</u> mother in her eyes.</p><p>My parents approved of my sister’s style of child-rearing. She had 4 daughters that she potty trained in 1 day with a wooden spoon. They ran <u>diaper</u> free all day, then when they relieved themselves, she hit them with the spoon and sat them on the pot. She carried that spoon everywhere she went, and had no problem hitting them wherever and whenever they misbehaved. Her primary goal was <u>obedience</u>.</p><p><strong>I allowed my kids to express their feelings, but made it clear that they still had to do what I told them to do.</strong> My family thought my kids were undisciplined and that I was unable to control them.</p><p>I refused to follow their child rearing methods, and I was comfortable with my style. <strong>I am proud of the <u>fine</u> men my sons turned out to be, and happy that they grew up knowing that their feelings were valid, and they were heard.</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(70, 118, 217);">▌</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Michelle-A-Rivera-2">Michelle A Rivera</a></strong></p><p>I’m a dog trainer and when you wrote about how she let them run around all day with no pants and then hit them I was horrified. But, I let my two sons run around with just a long t-shirt on and whenever they started to pee I picked them up and put them on the little potty. I really didn’t think it was a bad way to potty train. But positive reinforcement is powerful and when they finally got the concept they got praise and a sticker. It’s how I trained puppies, and it’s the only way I knew how. The point is to catch them in the act and show them the proper place to do that.

We tried to explain that we can’t afford it, and she stopped speaking with us. What should we do?</strong></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);"><em><strong>Tawni Doliveira</strong></em></span></p><blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">659.9k Views · 2.7k Upvotes</span></strong></p></blockquote><p>When I was 7, I was diagnosed with Type 1 <u>Diabetes</u>. I was in 2nd grade. My mom decided to get me a flip phone through Tracfone to text her if my blood sugar drops or if the nurse doesn’t show up to give me my <u>insulin</u> dose.</p><p>Every other year after that I got a new Tracfone for Christmas. When I turned 12 or 13, I asked my mom for a newer, better phone. I had just moved to the high school (7th-12th grade) and everyone else had nice iPhones. I knew my mom couldn’t afford an iPhone so I searched eBay for any phone that would do more than a cheap Tracfone.</p><p>At my school, teachers allow students to use a phone to search things, take pictures of <u>dissections</u> or powerpoints, or do our online assignments. I wanted to be able to be like everyone else and not have to go to get a teacher to unlock the room to the laptops to be able to do what others do or have to use a dictionary and have homework because it took too long to find the definitions.</p><p>I found a cheap android phone by the company Blu and my mom bought it for me. I loved it. My mom couldn’t afford data so I used the school’s WiFi.</p><p>About 2 years later, I wanted an iPhone. I got bullied for being poor and having a phone that became slow and was considered cheap. My mom got me a <u>refurbished</u> iPhone 6s Plus for Christmas 2016. I’m still using this phone and I love it.</p><p>Yes, I’d LOVE to have the newest iPhone but I’m very thankful to have this phone. My family hasn’t had an income for 4 years yet my mom figured out a way to get me a better phone that would last a while.</p><p>I’m NOT telling you that this is what you should do. What I’m saying is ask her why she thinks she needs an iPhone. Ask her why she feels that way. Try to compromise with her. But <u>hear her out</u>. Teenagers often feel as if their feelings are invalid and that we don’t have good points.</p><p>Have a conversation, don’t yell or raise your voice or have an attitude that screams “I’m better than you and only my points and views are valid”. It makes us more angry because our side of the conversation isn’t being heard.</p><p>All I’m saying is listen to her.

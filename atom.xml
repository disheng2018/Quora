She answered it and class moved on, but Jas had forgotten to mute herself. Jasmine was definitely one of the nicest people I have ever known. Extremely selfless, funny, and an all around really cool person. This is why it was so painful to hear what happened next.</p><p>Everyone in class heard screaming from her mic as she had forgotten to mute herself. A man’s voice, her dad, was screaming at her. His words sounded <u>slurred</u> so I assume he was drunk. He was calling her all kinds of terrible things.</p><p>It was so sad. We were all just silent. When the dad stopped, she realized she was unmuted. She was so apologetic and embarrassed, which just made it worse.</p><p><strong>Her dad ended up going to jail. She lives with her mom and siblings now and all is well. I talk with her daily and she’s doing great.</strong></p><details>  <summary><span style='color:white;font-weight:bold'>展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style='color:red;font-size:12pt'>翻译待更新<br></span></p></details><p><span style='color: rgb(70, 118, 217);'>▌</span><strong><span style='color: rgb(136, 136, 136);'>评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Maryke S:</strong></em><br>It sounds like she was incredibly fortunate to have forgotten to mute herself.

Why do women always date the worst kind of men? It’s so annoying.”</p><p>Well, I have the answer. It’s because we were lied to. Our entire childhood was a lie.</p><p>I remember that in <u>pre-school</u>, I was playing on the <u>swing set</u> of our school playground when suddenly, this boy named Liam (he was 4 years old) just walked over to me and pushed me off the swings without saying a WORD. He laughed and I just walked away. I had <u>scratches</u> all over my arms and legs and my face was covered with dirt.</p><p>It was my first time getting physically <u>bullied</u> during school and I was on the verge of tears the rest of the day. When I walked home, I cried to my mom and explained the entire thing to her. And you know what she said?</p><p>“Oh it’s okay, Tessa. He just <u>has a crush on</u> you.”</p><p>And from that day on, I was taught from the ripe age of 4 years old to confuse violence and affection. And if you’re a woman, I’m guessing you were taught that too. If you weren’t, you’re lucky.</p><p>Because resulting from that, I became attracted to <u>abusive</u> men.</p><p>Is that my fault? No.</p><p>Did I have to <u>unlearn</u> that? YES.</p><p>But instead of complaining about why women like certain types of men, maybe <strong>you should teach your kids that men shouldn’t be treating women poorly.</strong> We need to hold those boys accountable for their actions. No more “boys will be boys” bullshit.</p><p>And we need to teach women not to ignore this type of abuse at such a young age. It’s unacceptable.</p><p>Edit 1: It happens to boys too, not just girls!

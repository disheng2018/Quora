    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the difference between depression and laziness?</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);"><em><strong>Emily Payton</strong></em>,  BSc  Psychology (2021)</span></p><blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);">313.4K views · 1.8K upvotes</span></strong></p></blockquote><p>Lazy people get out of bed, because staying in bed all day is boring.</p><p>Lazy people shower, because being dirty is uncomfortable.</p><p>Lazy people form connections with others, because social relationships are rewarding.</p><p>Lazy people enjoy things. They enjoy food, or video games, or drinking, or masturbating, or smoking, or watching TV, or talking to friends on the phone all night. They have the capacity for excitement and happiness, even if the things that make them happy are 100% <u>hedonistic</u>.</p><p>Lazy people are relaxed. They are not afraid to go outside, or get out of bed or see people. They do not have panic attacks. They don’t fear being awake, so they don’t sleep all day. The thought of working – or failing – does not terrify them. They don’t hide their face. They see the value in being alive, and appreciate the world they are living in.</p><p>Lazy people generally don’t complain about hating themselves, or hating their life, or wanting to be better but being unable to do so – that’s too much effort for someone who is lazy. Someone who is lazy doesn’t care enough to think that way. I could see why a lazy person would lie about having depression to get out of doing something, but I doubt they would have the commitment to make it really convincing.</p><p><strong>Depression is not laziness.</strong> Sure, some of the behaviors are the same, and I can understand your confusion, but they actually look very different.</p><p>Saying that depression is the same as laziness is a bit like saying cats are the same as dogs, because they’re both furry and have four legs. Well, yes, but when you look a little closer you’ll recognize all the little shapes, joints and <u>quirks</u> that differentiate them.</p><details>  <summary><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt">翻译待更新<br></span></p></details><p><span style="color: rgb(70, 118, 217);">▌</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Leah Crawford:</strong></em><br>A wonderful answer.

She answered it and class moved on, but Jas had forgotten to mute herself. Jasmine was definitely one of the nicest people I have ever known. Extremely selfless, funny, and an all around really cool person. This is why it was so painful to hear what happened next.</p><p>Everyone in class heard screaming from her mic as she had forgotten to mute herself. A man’s voice, her dad, was screaming at her. His words sounded <u>slurred</u> so I assume he was drunk. He was calling her all kinds of terrible things.</p><p>It was so sad. We were all just silent. When the dad stopped, she realized she was unmuted. She was so apologetic and embarrassed, which just made it worse.</p><p><strong>Her dad ended up going to jail. She lives with her mom and siblings now and all is well.

But in spite of all her nosiness she failed to notice that Carol’s father was visiting her room regularly in the middle of the night.</p><p>When she tried to <u>bring the subject up</u> with her Mum she was shut down, her mother purposely misunderstood why Carol did not want her Dad in her bedroom.</p><p>The following year Carol won scholarship to two universities, both out of town. Her parents pressured her to attend her home town university so she could continue living at home and save them the cost of residence fees.</p><p>A few days later Carol jumped off an <u>overpass</u> on the highway. <strong>If a child wants a lock on their bedroom door for privacy, find out why.</strong></p><details>  <summary><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt">翻译待更新<br></span></p></details><p><span style="color: rgb(70, 118, 217);">▌</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Melia Janssen:</strong></em><br>Did Carol’s mother know about her father’s nightly visits afterwards? There should be some criminal charges pressed against parents who willingly drive their children to suicide.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Katrina Rachel:</strong></em><br>Oh yes, afterwards. But she did not leave him. My information was a case of he said, she said. No police officer would bring charges based on that evidence. And sadly it would not help Carol.

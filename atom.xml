We never have talked before, not even in person. This conversation happened between us,</p><p><strong>He:</strong> So, Aryan, what’s up?</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> (in confused voice) Who’s this?</p><p><strong>He:</strong> It’s Nitin, your classmate.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Ohh, okay.</p><p><strong>He:</strong> I called you because you are <u>studious</u> and it would be my pleasure to learn XYZ topic from you. I find that very tough.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Alright!</p><p>And the next day we met and I explained him the topic clearly. We talked about other stuff too. He talked about his crush and asked about mine too to which I replied——Nikita.</p><p>After that day, he started calling me after every 3–4 days and asked for explaining the topics he had problems with. I was more than happy to help him out as explaining him also helped me in my revision and strengthening of the topic and it’s concepts.</p><p>We use to talk for about an hour after that and I use to tell him all I know about Nikita and he use to tell me about his crush.</p><p>After 3 months, my best friend came to me and this conversation happened,</p><p><strong>He:</strong> Do you know that Nitin <u>proposed</u> to Nikita today!?</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> ……………………………. What……………………okay……..what!</p><p><strong>He:</strong> Yes, and Nikita accepted it too!</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> But how can she accept his proposal? He just proposed to her out of the blue and she accepted…..impossible!</p><p><strong>He:</strong> No, I heard that he has been talking to her for over 2 months now! I think the same time you started teaching him. He used all the things you told him about Nikita to <u>woo</u> her!</p><p>Yep, that turned out to be very true! He <u>backstabbed</u> me and stole my crush!</p><p>Trusting him and telling him the secret about my crush is something I wholeheartedly regret doing.</p><details>  <summary><span style='color:white;font-weight:bold'>展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style='color:red;font-size:12pt'>待更新<br></span></p></details><p><span style='color: rgb(70, 118, 217);'>▌</span><strong><span style='color: rgb(136, 136, 136);'>评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Alex Simon:</strong></em><br>Well that’s what crushes mean.

Why do women always date the worst kind of men? It’s so annoying.”</p><p>Well, I have the answer. It’s because we were lied to. Our entire childhood was a lie.</p><p>I remember that in <u>pre-school</u>, I was playing on the <u>swing set</u> of our school playground when suddenly, this boy named Liam (he was 4 years old) just walked over to me and pushed me off the swings without saying a WORD. He laughed and I just walked away. I had <u>scratches</u> all over my arms and legs and my face was covered with dirt.</p><p>It was my first time getting physically <u>bullied</u> during school and I was on the verge of tears the rest of the day. When I walked home, I cried to my mom and explained the entire thing to her. And you know what she said?</p><p>“Oh it’s okay, Tessa. He just <u>has a crush on</u> you.”</p><p>And from that day on, I was taught from the ripe age of 4 years old to confuse violence and affection. And if you’re a woman, I’m guessing you were taught that too. If you weren’t, you’re lucky.</p><p>Because resulting from that, I became attracted to <u>abusive</u> men.</p><p>Is that my fault? No.</p><p>Did I have to <u>unlearn</u> that? YES.</p><p>But instead of complaining about why women like certain types of men, maybe <strong>you should teach your kids that men shouldn’t be treating women poorly.</strong> We need to hold those boys accountable for their actions. No more “boys will be boys” bullshit.</p><p>And we need to teach women not to ignore this type of abuse at such a young age. It’s unacceptable.</p><p>Edit 1: It happens to boys too, not just girls!

When I voluntarily acted like a jerk to my then girlfriend, she just said “asshole!” and we didn’t speak for a while. That was a lifelong lesson. Such a statement is probably an overcorrection of the whole “nice guy problem”, which, again, quite simply, is about the problem of expecting something from a woman just for being “nice” to her.</p><p>And the ignoring part is just about not seeming (or actually not being) needy to the point of obsession. Everyone begins to feel smothered at some point, and it becomes rather uncomfortable. It really goes for both parties. Relying on the other person for personal fulfillment rather than actually having a life and goals makes the relationship tasteless and redundant.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for a good answer.</p></blockquote><p><span style='color: rgb(70, 118, 217);'>▌</span><strong><span style='color: rgb(136, 136, 136);'>词汇:</span></strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>turn sb. off</strong>: to make someone feel that they are not attracted to you in a sexual way使丧失性兴趣，反义词: turn on</li><li><strong>ingenious</strong>: &#x2F;ɪn’dʒinɪəs&#x2F; an ingenious plan, idea, or object works well and is the result of clever thinking and new ideas〔计划、主意或物体〕精巧的，巧妙的</li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://qr.ae/pGdSAr">https://qr.ae/pGdSAr</a></p>]]></content>

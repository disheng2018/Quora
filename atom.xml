Franklin knew that it would be beneficial to have this man on his side, but instead of <u>groveling</u> for his approval, he took a <u>counter-intuitive</u> approach. He knew his rival was in possession of a very rare and valuable book, and simply asked him to borrow it.

Basically, cognitive dissonance is the tension that results from having two contradictory beliefs in our mind at the same time.

Mom believed that grandson needed to be “<u>straightened out</u>“. I <u>was crushed to</u> think I wasn’t an <u>adequate</u> mother in her eyes. </p><p>My parents approved of my sister’s style of child-rearing.

She carried that spoon everywhere she went, and had no problem hitting them wherever and whenever they misbehaved.

I really didn’t think it was a bad way to potty train. But positive reinforcement is powerful and when they finally got the concept they got praise and a sticker.

And there were no parents to be seen.</p><p>I asked were my friends’ father was? At work, the answer went. He was always at work. His mother was “sick”, on bed with a headache.</p><p>Every time I was there, and I was there five or six times, dad was away at work, mom was sick with a headache.

I was in 2nd grade. My mom decided to get me a flip phone through Tracfone to text her if my blood sugar drops or if the nurse doesn’t show up to give me my <u>insulin</u> dose. </p><p>Every other year after that I got a new Tracfone for Christmas. When I turned 12 or 13, I asked my mom for a newer, better phone. I had just moved to the high school (7th-12th grade) and everyone else had nice iPhones. I knew my mom couldn’t afford an iPhone so I searched eBay for any phone that would do more than a cheap Tracfone.</p><p>At my school, teachers allow students to use a phone to search things, take pictures of <u>dissections</u> or powerpoints, or do our online assignments. I wanted to be able to be like everyone else and not have to go to get a teacher to unlock the room to the laptops to be able to do what others do or have to use a dictionary and have homework because it took too long to find the definitions.</p><p>I found a cheap android phone by the company Blu and my mom bought it for me. I loved it. My mom couldn’t afford data so I used the school’s WiFi.</p><p>About 2 years later, I wanted an iPhone. I got bullied for being poor and having a phone that became slow and was considered cheap. My mom got me a <u>refurbished</u> iPhone 6s Plus for Christmas 2016. I’m still using this phone and I love it.</p><p>Yes, I’d LOVE to have the newest iPhone but I’m very thankful to have this phone. My family hasn’t had an income for 4 years yet my mom figured out a way to get me a better phone that would last a while. </p><p>I’m NOT telling you that this is what you should do. What I’m saying is ask her why she thinks she needs an iPhone. Ask her why she feels that way. Try to compromise with her. But <u>hear her out</u>. Teenagers often feel as if their feelings are invalid and that we don’t have good points.</p><p>Have a conversation, don’t yell or raise your voice or have an attitude that screams “I’m better than you and only my points and views are valid”. It makes us more angry because our side of the conversation isn’t being heard.</p><p>All I’m saying is listen to her.

But in spite of all her nosiness she failed to notice that Carol’s father was visiting her room regularly in the middle of the night.</p><p>When she tried to <u>bring the subject up</u> with her Mum she was shut down, her mother purposely misunderstood why Carol did not want her Dad in her bedroom.</p><p>The following year Carol won scholarship to two universities, both out of town. Her parents pressured her to attend her home town university so she could continue living at home and save them the cost of residence fees.</p><p>A few days later Carol jumped off an <u>overpass</u> on the highway. <strong>If a child wants a lock on their bedroom door for privacy, find out why.</strong></p><details>  <summary><span style='color:white;font-weight:bold'>展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style='color:red;font-size:12pt'>翻译待更新<br></span></p></details><p><span style='color: rgb(70, 118, 217);'>▌</span><strong><span style='color: rgb(136, 136, 136);'>评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Melia Janssen:</strong></em><br>Did Carol’s mother know about her father’s nightly visits afterwards?

But she did not leave him. My information was a case of he said, she said. No police officer would bring charges based on that evidence. And sadly it would not help Carol.

Why do women always date the worst kind of men? It’s so annoying.”</p><p>Well, I have the answer. It’s because we were lied to. Our entire childhood was a lie.</p><p>I remember that in <u>pre-school</u>, I was playing on the <u>swing set</u> of our school playground when suddenly, this boy named Liam (he was 4 years old) just walked over to me and pushed me off the swings without saying a WORD. He laughed and I just walked away. I had <u>scratches</u> all over my arms and legs and my face was covered with dirt.</p><p>It was my first time getting physically <u>bullied</u> during school and I was on the verge of tears the rest of the day. When I walked home, I cried to my mom and explained the entire thing to her. And you know what she said?</p><p>“Oh it’s okay, Tessa. He just <u>has a crush on</u> you.”</p><p>And from that day on, I was taught from the ripe age of 4 years old to confuse violence and affection. And if you’re a woman, I’m guessing you were taught that too. If you weren’t, you’re lucky.</p><p>Because resulting from that, I became attracted to <u>abusive</u> men.</p><p>Is that my fault? No.</p><p>Did I have to <u>unlearn</u> that? YES.</p><p>But instead of complaining about why women like certain types of men, maybe <strong>you should teach your kids that men shouldn’t be treating women poorly.</strong> We need to hold those boys accountable for their actions. No more “boys will be boys” bullshit.</p><p>And we need to teach women not to ignore this type of abuse at such a young age. It’s unacceptable.</p><p>Edit 1: It happens to boys too, not just girls!

When I voluntarily acted like a jerk to my then girlfriend, she just said “asshole!” and we didn’t speak for a while. That was a lifelong lesson. Such a statement is probably an overcorrection of the whole “nice guy problem”, which, again, quite simply, is about the problem of expecting something from a woman just for being “nice” to her.</p><p>And the ignoring part is just about not seeming (or actually not being) needy to the point of obsession. Everyone begins to feel smothered at some point, and it becomes rather uncomfortable. It really goes for both parties. Relying on the other person for personal fulfillment rather than actually having a life and goals makes the relationship tasteless and redundant.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for a good answer.</p></blockquote><p><span style='color: rgb(70, 118, 217);'>▌</span><strong><span style='color: rgb(136, 136, 136);'>词汇:</span></strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>turn sb. off</strong>: to make someone feel that they are not attracted to you in a sexual way使丧失性兴趣，反义词: turn on</li><li><strong>ingenious</strong>: &#x2F;ɪn’dʒinɪəs&#x2F; an ingenious plan, idea, or object works well and is the result of clever thinking and new ideas〔计划、主意或物体〕精巧的，巧妙的</li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://qr.ae/pGdSAr">https://qr.ae/pGdSAr</a></p>]]></content>

Or would you think that the spark was dead?<br><br>When I was younger, I thought that getting married meant spending every evening together, watching the same shows together, playing games together, going for walks together, etc…<br><br>Trust me, it doesn’t take long for that whole “let’s spend every possible moment together” idea to get really, really old.<br><br><strong>Being <u>affectionate</u> to someone you love means doing things that will make them happy. You know what makes a lot of married adults happy? Guilt-free alone time.</strong><br><br>This is especially true for parents. If the kids go to bed at 9, and the parents go to bed at 10, that hour of kids asleep/parents awake time is sacred to the parents. Sacred alone time, that is.<br><br>Because I love my wife, I don’t bother her for an hour after the kids are asleep. Because she loves me, she doesn’t bother me during that hour, either. It’s been this way for years now, and our marriage just keeps getting stronger as the time goes by.</p><details>  <summary><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt">真正的朋友就是在一起的时候，即使不说话也不会觉得尴尬。<br></span></p></details><p><span style="color: rgb(70, 118, 217);">▌</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Sadhana Jayaram:</strong></em><br>Let there be spaces in your togetherness - Kahlil Gibran.</p></blockquote><p><span style="color: rgb(70, 118, 217);">▌</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">词汇:</span></strong></p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>affectionate</strong>: <u>/ə’fɛkʃənət/</u> showing in a gentle way that you love someone and care about them 表示爱的; 深情的</li></ul></blockquote><p><br><a href="https://qr.ae/pr8LUs">https://qr.ae/pr8LUs</a></p><p><br><img src="/images/Quora_qrcode.png" alt></p>]]></content>

Procrastinate on procrastinating.</li><li><strong>Do Something ASAP</strong> - When anything comes in your mind do something about it immediately, even if it is just planning it. Get it out of your head.</li><li><strong>Set Your Intentions -</strong> Know what you are going to do today. Lead the day actively.</li><li><strong>Check Things Off -</strong> When you are done with something make a clear-cut mark to be done with it.</li><li><strong>Start Early -</strong> Everyone works better in the morning. Do something difficult before you’d normally get up. You’ll feel great all day.</li><li><strong>Remind Yourself -</strong> 99% of all self-improvement is repetition. Multiple daily reminders ingrain concepts.</li><li><strong>Control Your Time -</strong> If you don’t control your time you’ll end up wasting a lot of it. You only have 24 hours each day and maybe only this one life; Don’t waste a single second.</li><li><strong>Go Outside -</strong> Add a bit of nature (ideally a natural body of water of some sort) to your daily routine. The calm will often reset you.</li><li><strong>Meditate</strong> - Work out your body, your mind and your heart and soul. Go inward. Learn about yourself. And improve.</li><li><strong>Love Yourself -</strong> Spend some time each day feeling proud or happy or loving with who you are. You spend 24 hours a day with yourself. That’s a long time to hate someone.</li><li><strong>Have Fun -</strong> Do something each day that’s just fun. Follow a hobby, pick up a new skill or read in your favorite book.</li><li><strong>Drink More Water -</strong> While 2L a day is recommended, 3–4L will really make you feel healthy and refreshed.</li><li><strong>Read A Book -</strong> 1 Chapter a day or 10 pages.</li><li><strong>Eat More Greens -</strong> Fruits and Vegetables over candy and snacks. Try having 3–4 Fruits or Veggies in every meal.</li><li><strong>Focus On Earning -</strong> Instead of trying save try to earn more. What could you do today that might make you and your time worth more?</li><li><strong>Act Big -</strong> Go for 10x more of what you think you want. Take it seriously and give it an honest shot. You’ll reach much further as your mental limits won’t hold you back as much.</li><li><strong>Reflect -</strong> Whatever you did, learn to reflect on it. What went well? What did not? What is one thing you <em>will</em> do better tomorrow?</li><li><strong>Be A Hero -</strong> First identify who that is and then take a step there daily. It makes an astounding difference when you choose where you want to go.</li><li><strong>Hug Someone -</strong> Release some oxytocin by being physical. If that is not possible then help someone. If you can’t do that, then be charitable.</li><li><strong>Be Present -</strong> This moment is all that matters. Take it in. You are alive now. Work with purpose, laugh with true joy or do what you need to do in the here and now.</li><li><strong>Break A Limit -</strong> Push a boundary and test your limits. Challenge yourself to be better than you were before so you move into who you want to be.</li></ol><details>  <summary><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt">翻译待更新<br></span></p></details><p><a href="https://qr.ae/prXA02">https://qr.ae/prXA02</a></p><p><br><img src="/images/Quora_qrcode.png"> </p>]]></content>

Wanna chill and play PubG ? Better use Sofa.</li><li>Stop using your phone as Alarm clock and if you can, keep your phone in the other room while sleeping. This way your phone won’t be the first thing you check in the morning and you are actually taking the temptation away. Try it, you will sleep much better and feel amazing in the morning.</li><li><strong>Stop eating sugar.</strong> Trust me, sugar does nothing good for you and will rot your brain. Wanna eat something sweet after a meal ? Try a couple of strawberries or grapes instead or some honey will also do the trick.</li><li>Start reading and I mean physical books. They are an amazing stress reliever.</li><li>Never stop dreaming and keep on setting goals. You must have heard the phrase “Never Settle” a number of times in life and there’s a reason for that. When you work towards something, towards a specific goal, then you’ll automatically be motivated to do other stuff. That energy, that feeling of seeing something in front of you and then working towards it is amazing.</li><li><strong>Exercise daily. Period.</strong></li><li><strong>Go outside for a minimum of 30 min daily and get some sunlight.</strong> Early morning is the best time. OUTSIDE GOOOODDD, INSIDE BAADDD.</li><li>Always use protection. All your success wouldn’t mean shit if you got an unexpected bun in the oven.</li><li>Never ever watch porn. No matter what happens, never ever watch porn. Use your imagination if need be but avoid porn at all cost. I can’t stress this point enough.</li><li><strong>Realize that life works at a very slow pace.</strong> This sounds a lot easy but trust me, its way more difficult in practical. In the age of internet, we easily develop the habit of instant gratification. Want something to eat ? It’s just 2 clicks away. Wanna order clothes ? Just pick your phone and select from latest trends and this will cost you less than actually visiting the store or a restaurant, thanks to discounts. This creates a habit loop of EXPECTING everything INSTANTLY, which is the number one reason for stress. We just don’t realize that everything takes time, that dreams are not achieved by working overnight and this is why most people give up. So slow down, take a deep breath and slowly but constantly work towards your goal.</li><li>In the pipelne.. edit coming soon ;)</li></ol><p>And never forget to enjoy life every chance you get. Realize that one day, not today, not tomorrow, but one day in distant future, probably in a galaxy far far away, you are going to die and everything will be for nothing. So work on yourself but make sure to enjoy in everything you pick to do in life.</p><details>  <summary><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt">翻译待更新<br></span></p></details><br>https://qr.ae/prXAE0<p><br><img src="/images/Quora_qrcode.png"> </p>]]></content>

I had built up and sold a business. Then did another one, and lost all our money.<br><br>I have done and said a lot of stupid things in my life. But saying I never wanted or was not ever going to have kids, would have been the stupidest, for me.<br><br><strong>I am a grandpa now, and our family and kids are our greatest joy.</strong> Oh sure it comes with a lot of responsibility, but isn’t anything that’s worthwhile.<br><br>My wife wanted a third, but I put my foot down, and got myself fixed.

These are among the best things I have ever learned:</p><ol><li>You spend your first 20 years worrying what people think about you. You spend your next 20 years swearing that you don’t care what people think about you. You spend the next 20 years realizing that they aren’t thinking about you. A liberation!</li><li>Any day on this side of the dirt is a good day. Some people didn’t make the cut last night. I was hit by a speeding taxi as I was walking to a bus stop. I spent a month in rehab with two broken legs, a brain injury, multiple back injuries and other <u>fractures</u>. The night before I was hit, a young, married couple was also hit. They both died. Practice gratitude.</li><li>A woman I know spends most of her time thinking about how much she hates her thighs. She can give you a detailed report on what is wrong with them. She forgets all the places those legs have taken her, all the miles they have walked for her. It doesn’t occur to her that when she gets up in the middle of the night to pee, those very thighs walk her to the toilet. <strong>Spend more time appreciating what you’ve got</strong>— a heart that beats, a way to pick up your cup of coffee, the eyes that see that cup and know what color it is. Blessings abound.</li><li>There are two kinds of people in this world – those who believe there is enough to go around, and those who don’t. Here is an example: If Margo is leaning up against the car kissing her boyfriend, and I think how nice that must feel, do I try to steal Margo’s boyfriend or do I go out and get my own boyfriend? I go out and get myself a boyfriend. I don’t need to steal Margo’s. I know that there is enough to go around.</li><li>An old Native American woman was asked why she was always so happy. She said that she has two wolves in her heart and they are both hungry— one wolf is angry and evil, the other wolf is filled with love, and that’s the only one she feeds.</li></ol><details>  <summary><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt">翻译待更新<br></span></p></details><p><span style="color: rgb(70, 118, 217);">▌</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Mary Osborne:</strong></em><br>I love this answer so much.

One morning, my mom was going downstairs to make dad breakfast, she had a heart attack and fell. My father picked her up as best he could and almost dragged her into the truck. At full speed, without respecting traffic lights, he drove her to the hospital.</p><p>When he arrived, unfortunately, she was no longer with us.</p><p>During the funeral, my father did not speak; his gaze was lost. He hardly cried.</p><p>That night, his children joined him. In an atmosphere of pain and <u>nostalgia</u>, we remembered beautiful anecdotes and he asked my brother, a <u>theologian</u>, to tell him where Mom would be at that moment. My brother began to talk about life after death, and guesses as to how and where she would be.</p><p>My father listened carefully. Suddenly he asked us to take him to the <u>cemetery</u>.</p><p>Dad!” we replied, “it’s 11 at night, we can’t go to the cemetery right now!”</p><p>He raised his voice, and with a <u>glazed</u> look he said:</p><p>“Don’t argue with me, please don’t argue with the man who just lost his wife of 55 years.”</p><p>There was a moment of respectful silence, we didn’t argue anymore. We went to the cemetery, we asked the night <u>watchman</u> for permission. With a flashlight, we reached the tomb. My father <u>caressed</u> her, prayed, and told his children, who watched the scene moved:</p><blockquote><p>“It was 55 years… you know? No one can talk about true love if they have no idea what it’s like to share life with a woman.”</p></blockquote><p>He paused and wiped his face. </p><blockquote><p>“She and I, we were together in that crisis. I changed jobs …” he continued. “We packed up when we sold the house and moved out of town. We shared the joy of seeing our children finish their careers, we mourned the departure of loved ones side by side, we prayed together in the waiting room of some hospitals, we support each other in pain, we hug each Christmas, and we forgive our mistakes…</p><p>Children, now it’s gone, and I’m happy, do you know why?</p><p><strong>Because she left before me. She didn’t have to go through the <u>agony</u> and pain of burying me, of being left alone after my departure.</strong> I will be the one to go through that, and I thank God. I love her so much that I wouldn’t have liked her to suffer…”</p></blockquote><p>When my father finished speaking, my brothers and I had tears streaming down our faces. We hugged him, and he comforted us, “It’s okay, we can go home, it’s been a good day.”</p><p>That night I understood what true love is; It is far from <u>romanticism</u>, it does not have much to do with <u>eroticism</u>, or with sex, rather it is linked to work, to complement, to care and, above all, to the true love that two really <u>committed</u> people <u>profess</u>“.</p><p>Peace in your hearts.</p><p>Love and Light.</p><details>  <summary><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">展开翻译</span></summary>  <p><span style="color:red;font-size:12pt">待更新</span></p></details><p><span style="color: rgb(70, 118, 217);">▌</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">评论:</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Luiza Carneiro:</strong></em><br>Love is not <u>infatuation</u> as lots of people believe.
